        <h3>Space Invaders!</h3>

<p>This game was especially fun to make because I can actually win. (I don't get to win at video games very much...)</p>

<p><strong>What was the hardest part of building this game?</strong> Checking for collisions between bullets, invaders, and the spaceship. It ended up being fairly easy, but it's much easier to check for collisions between circles (my default for JavaScript games). </p>

<p><strong>If I had a few more hours, what would I improve?</strong> A few of the functions could use some DRYING up. It's a good feeling when your code works, but an even better feeling when it's DRY.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
