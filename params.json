{"name":"Space Invaders","tagline":"Shoot down the aliens, retro style","body":"###Space Invaders!\r\n\r\nThis game was especially fun to make because I can actually win. (I don't get to win at video games very much...)\r\n\r\n**What was the hardest part of building this game?** Checking for collisions between bullets, invaders, and the spaceship. It ended up being fairly easy, but it's much easier to check for collisions between circles (my default for JavaScript games). \r\n\r\n**If I had a few more hours, what would I improve?** A few of the functions could use some DRYING up. It's a good feeling when your code works, but an even better feeling when it's DRY.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
